# BERT_custom

1. Extracted wiki data using Beautifulsoup library and saved in train_noi.txt.

2. In bert.ipynb, converted 15% words to <noise> token in a sentence.

3. Training for 1000 iterations.

4. Predict output on few sentences.

Input/output combinations:

Input:

The model used an uncertainty metric to determine whether patient data were too different from what it had been trained on for it to be able to make a successful prediction

output:

the model used an uncertainty used to determine whether is data and too different from what it had been trained

Input:

Here are some critical AI terms that you need to know [we will be updating this glossary on a regular basis, so we recommend checking in on it routinely

output:

here and some critical ai to that you need that know to of be updating this glossary on a regular

Input:

A set of instructions or rules used - often by a computer - to solve a set of problems, execute calculations or process data

output:

a set of instructions or a used often by a a to solve a a of a a calculations or

Input:

the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data

output:

the process of using data analysis to is properties of an underlying the distribution inferential statistical analysis the properties of

Input:

it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population

output:

it does not vision on the assumption that the data come from a users population of does and vision on

Input:

Promoter analysis involves the identification and study of sequence motifs in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. Enhancer elements far away from the promoter can also regulate gene expression

output:

promoter analysis involves the identification and study of sequence artificial in the dna variables the when statistics of the gene

Input:

In between them are zero or more hidden layers. Single layer and unlayered networks are also used

output:

in between them are between or more hidden layers single layer and lot networks are also used in between them
